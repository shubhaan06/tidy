# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones - Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project contains scripts and documentation for cleaning and processing the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to prepare a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis.

## Repository Contents
- `run_analysis.R`: Main script for data processing
- `CodeBook.md`: Description of variables, data, and transformations
- `tidy_data.txt`: Final processed dataset (generated by running the script)

## Prerequisites
The script requires the following R packages:
- dplyr
- tidyr

You can install them using:
```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr"))
```

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Set your R working directory to the repository folder
3. Source the script:
```R
source("run_analysis.R")
```
4. Run the analysis:
```R
tidy_dataset <- run_analysis()
```

The script will:
- Download the dataset if it's not already present
- Process the data according to the project requirements
- Create a file called `tidy_data.txt` in your working directory

## Script Workflow
1. Downloads and unzips the dataset
2. Reads training and test datasets
3. Merges the datasets
4. Extracts mean and standard deviation measurements
5. Applies descriptive activity names
6. Labels variables descriptively
7. Creates a tidy dataset with averages per activity and subject

## Output
The script produces a tidy dataset where each row represents average measurements for each subject and activity combination. The output is saved as `tidy_data.txt`.

## Notes
- The script automatically handles downloading and unzipping the data
- All intermediate data processing is done in memory
- The final dataset is written to disk as a text file
